\section{Dataset Overview}
Throughout this paper, I will be using the US Accidents (2016 - 2023) Dataset \citep{sobhanmoosavi_2023}. Before starting any analysis, it is essential to understand what data is provided. The data columns are described in \cref{section:traffic_attrs}, \cref{section:address_attrs}, \cref{section:weather_attrs}, \cref{section:poi_attrs}, and \cref{section:pod_attrs}. All data processing, analysis, and visualization are performed in Python \cref{code:python}.
